This is Roman Gort's protocol to clean and sterilise reusable deep well plates

1. Autoclave plates with bacterial cultures using program #7 (liquid waste)
2. If no heat-resistant antibiotics were inside, empty and rinse the plates in the sink using tap water
3. Place the plates inside the cleaning bath for 24h. If no bath is ready to use, fill one of the big plastic tubs with 12 L of tap water, add 120 mL detergent and mix well
4. Further clean the plates using dish washer program #5. For this, place the plates upside down in the metal basket (leaving one or two out in the middle because the water jets don't reach there) and weigh them with a metal grid. Place the plate lids inside of the metal cage on the top dish washer drawer
5. Once clean, place the plates and lids standing on their side in the drying machine at 70Â°C for 3 hours
6. Put two pieces of autoclaving tape on the plate lids perpendicularly across the plate lid and down the sides to keep the lid on the plate. Stick the very end of the autoclaving tape back on itself the make it easier to take it off later
7. Cut off pieces of the autoclaving bag in the necessary length for the amount of plates you would like per bag. Make sure to leave enough extra on both ends to seal the bag
8. Place the welding machine on the bench and a bottom side-up metal tray next to it. Make at least three welds on one side of the bag, moving the bag by a few millimeters between each weld. Make sure to press down on the welder to create a proper seal and hold the welder a bit longer for the first of the welds to make sure it warms up properly
9. Place plates inside of the bag and make at least three welds on the other side of the bag to seal it. Finally, stick a piece of autoclave tape to the back of the bag and label it
10. Put the metal frame inside of the autoclave, place a bottle rack inside and prop the bags with the plates up in a standing position between the spikes. Use autoclave program #10, which sterilises for 20 instead of 30 minutes but has a longer drying phase afterwards
11. Plates are ready to use!
